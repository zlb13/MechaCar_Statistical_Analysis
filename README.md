## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
There is a significant linear relationship with all variables, so all variables are non randaom. The linear model predicts the mpg of MechaCar protypes effectively because the r-squared value of o.71 is  71% of variablilty of the dependent variables is explained using this linear model. In addtion the p-value is smaller than signficance level of 0.05 %. Therefore, we can state there is signifigance evidence to reject the null hypothesis which means slope is not 0 and anticipate the linear model will perfom well.

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
The manufacturing data meets the design specifications for all manufacuturing lots, because the total variance is 62.3 and does not exceed the 100 pounds per square inch. Indiviually the design specifications only meets for Lot1 and Lot2 who variancde is under the 100 pounds per square inch. Lot3 does not meet the design specifications because it variance is 170.3 which exceeds the  100 pounds per square inch.

## T-test on Suspension Coils

The is no statisical difference for the PSI across all manufacturing lots and no statistical diffenece from each indivual Manufacturing lots.

## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition
A study to quantify how MechaCar performs against the competition can be done with a two sample paired t-Test. The metrics tested in the study will include p-value and significance level. The data will include number of cylinders and engine size, mpg. The alteranative hypothesis is MechaCar does not perform better with mpg than the competition based on engine size and number of cylinders.
